## Reflection Document

Below are indivudal section reflections.

## Section 01-html reflections

I completed all exercises independently, but double checked my work with yours at the end. All exercises were helpful for me to reinforced my understanding of HTML following the lectures. I think you explained them very well and there could be a more challenge lab (maybe optional) in this section.

## Section 02-a11y reflections

I completed all exercises independently, but double checked my work with yours at the end. The exercise was straightforward and helped strengthen my understanding of HTML forms. It was simple enough that I found this quite easy to manage after lecture. There wasn't anything in the exercise that I felt needed further explanation; they were clear and to the point.

## Section 03-css reflections

I completed all the exercises partially on my own and partially with the help of video solutions. Each exercise was very helpful in deepening my understanding of fundamental CSS, as opposed to relying on CSS frameworks. Both the lecture and the video explained CSS concepts very effectively.

## Section 04-flexbox reflections

I completed all the exercises independently using the lecture PowerPoint for reference, but I double-checked my work with yours at the end. This exercise was both fun and helpful, allowing me to arrange elements in different ways within a container. You explained everything very well in the lecture, and I was able to finish the exercises by referring to the lecture slides.

## Section 05-css-grid reflections

I completed all the exercises partially on my own and partially with the help of video solutions. I don't have much experience arranging grids in pure CSS, but it was both fun and helpful for me. Your lecture PowerPoint and video explained the concepts very well, allowing me to navigate through and finish this lab quite quickly and enjoyably.

## Section 06-bootstrap reflections

I completed all the exercises independently but double-checked my work against yours at the end. Having some prior experience with Bootstrap components, this section served as a refresher for me. I'm sure it's helpful for people who are new to the Bootstrap framework. You covered many basic aspects of Bootstrap in class, and I think they are definitely helpful for gaining a better understanding of the framework.

## Section 07-javascript reflections

I completed all the exercises partially on my own and partially with the help of video solutions because I wanted to better understand your expectations for this section. I have some experience with JavaScript, this section refreshed my knowledge of basic functionalities and introduced me to some new concepts from the lecture as well. This section definitely helped me gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental concepts of JavaScript.

## Section 08-jquery reflections

I completed all the exercises mostly with the help of video solutions. I have no experience with jQuery, but being able to recognize and write jQuery could really benefit me in the future for understanding codebases that contain jQuery. You explained everything very well, and the exercises were very helpful.
